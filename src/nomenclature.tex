\subsection{Common terms}

For the sake of consistency in the terms used in this document, we will refer to the naming conventions and definitions as outlined in \cite{1335465}. Below are the definitions of the most crucial terms used. \\

\textbf{Failure} is an event that occurs when the delivered service deviates from correct service. A service fails either because it does not comply with the functional specification, or because this specification did not adequately describe the system function. A service failure is a transition from correct service to incorrect service, i.e., to not implementing the system function \cite{1335465}. \\

\textbf{Error} is a deviation of the service from its correct state. It is a part of the system's state that may lead to service failure \cite{1335465}. Errors are the observable result of issues within the software and or hardware. \\

\textbf{Fault} is the actual or hypothesized cause of an error. Faults are usually considered dormant until manifested, causing an error \cite{1335465}. An example of a fault might be hardware issue causing an I/O device to send corrupted data as input. If the software is not designed to deal with incorrect input this would lead to an internal error, possibly causing a service failure. \\

\textbf{Fault tolerance} is the ability to avoid service failures in the presence of faults.
