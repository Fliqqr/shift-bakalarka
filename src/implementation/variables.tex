\subsection{Protection of variables} \label{sec:var_protection}

Various unforeseeable circumstances can lead to the corruption of program variables, from direct corruption of registers storing the variables to indirect side-effect originating from errors within function that work with said variables. This section focuses on various techniques implemented to ensure the reliability of critical program variables with varying degree of protection depending on the use case.

\subsubsection{Copy and commit}

Copy and commit is a method inspired by a common practice in database transaction handling, where a temporary copy of the variable is created and modified instead of the original value. Upon an explicit commit, the original variable is overwritten with the modified copy. This pattern resembles \textit{libft} \cite{libft} variable protection and is particularly useful in combination with checkpoint and restart to avoid unintended side-effects. In the Rust example shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rust_copy_commit}, a CopyCommit wrapper is used to hold a temporary copy of the value. Inside the bar function, the value is incremented, but the change only takes effect on the original data when commit() is called. This allows for greater control over when and how mutations are finalized.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust]
fn bar(mut a: CopyCommit<u32>) {
    *a += 1;
    a.commit();
}

fn foo() {
    let mut a = 1;
    bar(CopyCommit::new(&mut a));
}
\end{lstlisting}

\label{fig:rust_copy_commit}
\end{figure}

While this method gives us more control over when variables are modified and helps prevent unwanted side-effects, it inherently does not provide any fault tolerance against direct corruption of variables. As such, it should only be reserved for non-critical parts of the program, and or combined with other variable protection techniques.

\subsubsection{Multiple redundant variables}

Another way we can secure a variable is creating multiple copies of it and applying any modification to all the copies. The modified copies are then compared against each other to detect any mismatch. With two copies of a variable, we can detect an error but cannot correct it, since we cannot tell which one of the copies is faulty - we can use this to trigger backward recovery via the checkpoint system. With three copies, we can detect an error but also perform correction (if at least two copies of the variable are equal) effectively performing forward recovery and avoiding rollback. The more copies we create the more likely we are to have a majority of the variables be equal, therefore the more confident we can be in our fault-tolerance.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust]
// Creates 3 identical copies
let mut a = MultiVar::new(0);
// Applies the edit function to each of the copies and performs equality check
if let Err(e) = a.edit(|ptr_a| {
    *ptr_a += 1;
}) {
    // Error while updating variable
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Rust - Multiple variable redundancy}
\label{fig:multivar}
\end{figure}

In our implementation, a MultiVar wrapper around a variable is used to automatically instantiate three separate copies of the variable as seen in Figure \ref{fig:multivar}. By calling the edit function on the wrapper, we map any modification to all the copies of the variable. The edit function also includes an internal checks which tries to correct the variables in a case of a mismatch. If correction is not possible this function returns an error.

Unfortunately, even if the stored variables are correct, faults can still manifest on the ALU directly while the variable is being read, effectively behaving as if the stored variable was erroneous. Due to this, variable protection alone can never give us complete certainty in any computed result.
